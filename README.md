# üëæ Abhishek Sharma 
> Building software like IKEA furniture ‚Äì confusing docs, existential crises, but somehow, it works.

## üöÄ What I‚Äôm Up To
- **Seeking my next challenge** in full-stack and AI engineering.
- **Architecting the next evolution of AI-powered scheduling.** Currently in [stealth mode](https://schedge.vercel.app/). ü§´
- **Fresh off my SDE Internship @ [Stardom](https://stardom.co.in)**, where I shipped production code and learned a ton.
- **Deep in my Android dev arc** ‚Äì Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, and the usual existential dread.  
- **My First Android App is Live!** ‚Äì [Retask](https://github.com/abhisheksharm-3/retask/releases/) ‚Äì another Todo app, but with ‚ú® vibes ‚ú®.  

## üí° How I Build

I write code the way I try to live ‚Äî  
**curious, slightly chaotic, and always shipping.**

- **I obsess over a flawless user experience, not a flawless pixel grid.** Users remember how an app *feels*, not if a button is 2px off-center.
- **I aim for code that speaks for itself.** For everything else, there's JSDoc.
- **Shipping > Perfection.** I'd rather iterate on a live product than chase a unicorn in a local branch.
- **Simplicity is my north star.** Clever code creates technical debt; clean code creates value.
- **Design isn't just what it looks like.** It's how it works. I'm obsessed with clean, intuitive UI/UX.

*It's all talk until you ship something. Here‚Äôs the proof:*

## üß© Projects That Stuck
- üó£Ô∏è **[Chat With Anything](https://chat-with-anything.vercel.app/)** ‚Äì Taught an AI to read. Now it chats with PDFs, images, and basically anything you throw at it. Orchestrated a whole mess of services (LangChain, Pinecone, Gemini) to make it happen without setting my laptop on fire.
- üîó **[QuickGist](https://quickgist.vercel.app/)** ‚Äì Built a code-sharing tool in Go and React because pasting code into Slack was making me sad. It‚Äôs fast, reliable, and my friends actually use it.
- üîê **[Credify](https://github.com/abhisheksharm-3/credify)** ‚Äì Built a media attribution system using metadata and watermarking. Think of it like a digital receipt for your content.

*To make all that happen, I rely on a toolbox full of things I know, things I'm learning, and things I occasionally swear at:*

## üõ∏ The Odd Truths
- Accidentally became the "resume guy" with [getresume](https://getresumes.vercel.app) ‚Äì now I know way too much about ATS filters.  
- Dockerized a project once just to feel something.  
- My debugging process: write `console.log()`, stare at the screen, question my life choices.  
- My diet consists of black coffee and compiler errors.
